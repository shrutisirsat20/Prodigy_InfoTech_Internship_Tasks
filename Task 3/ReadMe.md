# Task 3: Decision Tree Classifier

## Objective
The objective of this task is to build a Decision Tree Classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data.

## Dataset Used
The Bank Marketing dataset was used for this task. The dataset contains customer information such as age, job, education, loan details, campaign data, and a target column indicating whether the customer purchased the product or not.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Google Colab
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

## Steps Performed
- Uploaded and read the dataset in Google Colab
- Checked the dataset for missing values
- Separated features (X) and target variable (y)
- Converted target values from yes/no to 1/0
- Converted categorical features using one-hot encoding
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets
- Built and trained a Decision Tree Classifier
- Made predictions on test data
- Evaluated the model using accuracy score

## Outcome
The Decision Tree model was able to predict customer purchase behavior with good accuracy. This task helped in understanding the complete workflow of building a basic machine learning classification model.
